# Replication package for the submission "Improving the Readability of Automatically Generated Tests using Large Language Models" at ICST 2025

The following repository contains the code of the readability improvement tool, the code to analyze the results, as well as the raw data related to the human study. The repository is structured in the following subdirectories:

- [classes-readability-survey](classes-readability-survey/README.md) contains all the classes of the five Java projects, that we selected for the internal class selection. It also contains the tests generated by Evosuite for each class;

- [code-analysis](code-analysis/README.md) contains the code to analyze the raw data coming from RQ2 (`stability_data.json`) and RQ3 (`qualtrics_data.json`). The two scripts are called `analyze_stability_data.py` and `analyze_survey_data.py` respectively.

- [qualification-test](qualification-test/README.md) contains the `Lift.java` class with an injected bug we used for the qualification test.

- [readability-improvement-tool](readability-improvement-tool/README.md) contains the code of the readability improvement tool.

- [survey-prints](survey-prints/README.md) contains the pdf files of the surveys (i.e., class selection and developer survey) on qualtrics.
